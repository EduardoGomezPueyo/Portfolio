## The problem

Most restaurant booking apps treat reservations as a simple transaction: pick a date, pick a time, done. But for users with dietary restrictions, allergies, or those planning group meals, the lack of accessible nutritional and menu information forces them to leave the app entirely — searching restaurant websites, calling ahead, or simply choosing somewhere else.

Sakura Sushi started with a question: **what if the booking experience also helped users make informed decisions about what they'll eat?**

## Research & Discovery

I began with an assumption that most users just want to book quickly and move on. Early interviews challenged that directly.

Conversations with potential users revealed two underserved groups: people managing food allergies who need ingredient-level detail before committing to a restaurant, and users organizing meals for others — parents with children who have medical dietary needs, or professionals booking for groups with varied preferences. For both groups, a reservation without menu confidence was a reservation they wouldn't make.

This shifted the design direction from "fast booking" to **"informed booking"** — speed still mattered, but not at the cost of the information users actually needed to feel safe choosing a restaurant.

## Personas

Two personas emerged from the research to anchor design decisions:

**Rachel, 26 — Junior Web Developer.** Lives with multiple food allergies. She doesn't book anywhere without checking ingredients first. Her current process involves cross-referencing the restaurant's website, third-party allergy apps, and sometimes calling the restaurant directly. She needs ingredient transparency built into the experience, not bolted on as an afterthought.

**Thomas, 35 — Business Operations Manager.** Frequently books dinners for clients and colleagues with diverse dietary needs. He can't afford a booking that leads to an awkward situation at the table. He needs a way to quickly assess whether a restaurant can accommodate a group — not just whether a table is available.

## Design process

### From paper to pixels

I started with paper sketches to explore layout options without getting attached to visual details. The initial concept placed booking, menu, and restaurant info in separate tabs — a conventional pattern that felt logical on paper.

### What testing revealed

Usability testing with five participants exposed three problems I hadn't anticipated:

1. **The app didn't read as a booking tool.** Because menu and recipe content was prominent, multiple participants assumed the app was a recipe platform. The core function — reservations — wasn't clear enough at first glance.

2. **Booking felt fragmented.** Splitting reservation inputs across multiple screens created unnecessary friction. Participants lost track of their selections and wanted to see everything in one place before confirming.

3. **Everyone asked about guest access.** Unprompted, several participants questioned why account creation was required. For a restaurant booking, the expectation was low-commitment — closer to ordering coffee than signing up for a service.

These findings drove three rounds of iteration, each directly tied to a specific testing insight.

## Solutions

### Reframing the home screen

The first redesign prioritized booking and menu access as the two primary actions on the home screen. Recipe content — which users valued but misidentified as the app's purpose — was repositioned as a secondary feature. This single change resolved the identity confusion without removing functionality.

### One-Screen booking with confirmation

All reservation inputs were consolidated into a single interface: date, time, party size, and seating preferences visible together. A confirmation screen was added as a final step, displaying every detail before submission. Participants in follow-up testing reported feeling more in control of the process.

### Flexible Authentication

Three pathways were introduced: Google sign-in for speed, email registration for users who wanted saved preferences, and guest checkout for those making a one-time reservation. This removed the biggest friction point without sacrificing the benefits of accounts for returning users.

### Recipes as a retention feature

Rather than cutting the recipe section, it was repositioned as a value-add — a way for users to recreate restaurant dishes at home. This responded to a real behavior pattern observed during research: users who enjoyed a meal often searched for similar recipes afterward. Keeping this feature maintained engagement beyond the transactional booking moment.

## Reflection

The biggest lesson from this project was how quickly initial assumptions fell apart under research. What started as a "make booking faster" brief became a more nuanced problem about **information confidence** — users didn't just want to book, they wanted to book *knowing* they'd made the right choice.

If I were to continue iterating, I'd focus on two areas: adding allergen filtering directly into the menu browsing experience, and exploring how Thomas's use case — group bookings with mixed dietary needs — could be better supported with shareable reservation previews.

This project reinforced something I keep coming back to: the most useful design decisions come from watching people struggle with something you thought was obvious.
