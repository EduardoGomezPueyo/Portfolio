## Context

**Harmonix** is a tool that sits on top of users' existing CRM workspaces — Outlook, Salesforce, Dynamics, LinkedIn — and unifies their communication and information tools. It works primarily through a browser extension that adapts to the content of each web page, but it also includes a web application that serves as a control center: settings for administrators and personalization for each user (signature, default phone numbers, avatar...).

As a Google Chrome extension, it requires specific Google permissions to overlay on any web page.

## The Problem

The extension had an architectural problem that directly affected the experience. Every time a user navigated to a new page, a new instance of the extension was loaded — with its own phone dialer, email, messaging — which caused conflicts between instances, unexpected reloads, and loss of context. On top of that, each web page has a different internal structure, which required a custom adaptation process to ensure the extension didn't cover or displace each site's native elements.

The result was an extension that behaved unreliably and required a disproportionate technical effort to maintain.

The opportunity appeared when Google introduced the Side Panel: a dedicated browser space for extensions, independent of page content. A single instance, no need to inject into every page, no conflicts. This wasn't just a technical improvement — it was a chance to rethink the entire experience of the core product.

## What Customers Told Us

Customer feedback reflected the architectural problems as concrete frustrations: calls sometimes didn't come through, the extension reloaded after a period of inactivity, it sometimes didn't appear where it should, and synchronization between views wasn't reliable. These were different symptoms of the same underlying issue — each page loaded its own instance and there was no guarantee of stability.

But beyond the technical problems, conversations with customers also revealed something about the product itself: there were features nobody used. The nurturing section, the outbox, certain views that had been added over time — customers didn't mention them because they simply ignored them. Meanwhile, the features they actually valued — contact detail, activity history, follow-up suggestions — were buried among everything else.

The redesign couldn't just be a change of container. It also had to be an opportunity to decide what deserved to keep existing.

### One Instance, One Persistent Context

Migrating to the Side Panel solved the multiple-instance problem at its root. The extension now lives in a single browser space, independent of whatever page the user has open. This eliminated unexpected reloads, dialer conflicts, and context loss when navigating. For development it meant a much more manageable control point; for users, an extension that finally behaves predictably.

### Removing What's Unused, Merging What's Redundant

The change of container brought the opportunity to review all the content. Sections nobody used — nurturing, outbox — were removed. Those that were too similar, like tasks and inbox, were merged into a single view. The goal was for every element in the Side Panel to justify its presence: if it didn't deliver demonstrable value, it didn't deserve the space.

### Reorganizing Navigation for a Smaller Space

The original extension had a left sidebar for navigating between general views (tasks, inbox, pipeline) and a contact detail area on the right with activity history, follow-up suggestions, and AI agent reports. When compressing everything into the Side Panel, that structure no longer worked. Navigation was redesigned so that primary views and contact detail could coexist fluidly in a smaller space, prioritizing what users consulted most frequently.

## Reflection

This was a year-long project and the hardest decision wasn't technical — it was deciding what to remove. When you've been designing a product for a while, you know every feature and you know how to work around its problems, which makes it easy to justify keeping everything. But customers don't see what you see: they see features they ignore competing for space with the ones they actually need.

The Side Panel migration forced that conversation. It wasn't possible to carry everything over as-is into a smaller space, so every feature had to earn its place. That constraint turned out to be the project's best design tool: it forced decisions that had been pending for a long time.

If I were to continue iterating, I'd focus on measuring how the simplification has affected adoption of the features that were kept, and on exploring how the Side Panel could adapt contextually — surfacing different information depending on which page the user has open, without falling back into the problems of the previous architecture.
