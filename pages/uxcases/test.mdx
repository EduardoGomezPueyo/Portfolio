# Mimic, an indepth UX project

Mimic is a music discovery service that primarily allows for users to share their music taste with the press of a button. With current music applications, the data visualization and sharing of music taste aspects are either non-existent, very limited, or extremely outdated. Mimic aims to fix that by bridging the gap between potential playlist favorites and music enthusiasts themselves.
